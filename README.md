# DiscGolfBagManager
## Overview
DiscGolfBagManager is aimed to help disc golfers manage the discs in their bag and give recommendations to make their bag more well-rounded.  This app will also give users a notification after their round to remind them to check their bag for all discs.  One of the biggest reasons why I and other disc golfers lose discs is because they forget to pick a disc up after a hole and don't realize it's gone until later.
## Current progress
DiscGolfBagManager currently gives users the ability to customize their bag with a selection of discs.  Users can remove discs from their bag, add discs from their collection to their bag, and add reccomendations to their collection.
## Future goals
The best way to minimize lost discs is to remind a disc golfer to pick up the disc they previously threw.  DiscGolfBagManager will let users selected what disc they threw on each shot during a round.  Once they input their next shot, the app will display an alert asking if they picked up their previous disc.
